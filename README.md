# CRUD Nodejs and Mysql
this is a basic application crud that uses nodejs in the backend, mysql as database.

#Tasks :- 
- [ ] Explore this repository code and figure out what files are there and what's the purpose of this application.
Scenario
-  Now ! You are working on architecting a robust and scalable system for a fast-growing e-commerce platform. The platform demands a highly available and fault-tolerant backend  to handle heavy user traffic and ensure data integrity. Additionally, it requires efficient utilization of storage resources to handle large volumes of customer data and ensure optimal performance.
- [ ] Make sure the application & database are highly available & fault tolerant.
- [ ] We need two different environments i.e. (dev. and prod.) both should run the same application but database should be different.
- [ ] Design the architecture such that there should be not more than one LoadBalancer for both the envs. combined.
- [ ] Make sure the application is accessed by yourname.dev.myupflairs.com (Dev. Environment) and yourname.prod.myupflairs.com (Prod. Environemnt) from your local machine. (Make sure to replace yourname with your name)
- [ ] This application creates a file named user.txt at /data/users/ location (For both env.)
- [ ] Make sure these files are shared such that it can be accessible via SFTP (Single Endpoint)

#Useful Tips
- There's a database directory which contains a .sql file, check it if it's useful or not.
